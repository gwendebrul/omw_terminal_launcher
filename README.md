# Terminal launcher

This applescript launches terminal and create a number of tabs and executes a number of commands on each tab.
This was created because I daily open terminal and make 5 tabs, each tab I ssh into my server and change the directory.
So I decided to automate this.

## Installation
1. download and open this script in applescript editor.
2. Change the variables at the beginning of the file.
3. You don't have to change anything else.
4. Save it as an application and you're good to go.

I used hotkey app for creating a shortcut, when I press F1 the script is executed.

Enjoy!!
